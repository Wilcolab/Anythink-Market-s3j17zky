/**
 * PROMPT: Create a function that converts strings to camelCase
 * 
 * Write a JavaScript function called `toCamelCase` that takes a string as input
 * and converts it to camelCase format. The function should:
 * 
 * - Remove spaces, hyphens, and underscores
 * - Convert the first letter of each word (except the first word) to uppercase
 * - Keep the first letter of the entire string lowercase
 * - Handle multiple separators gracefully
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: "hello world example"
 * Output: "helloWorldExample"
 * 
 * Additional test cases:
 * - "user_name" should become "userName"
 * - "API-response-data" should become "apiResponseData"
 * - "  multiple   spaces  " should become "multipleSpaces"
 * - "already_camelCase" should become "alreadyCamelCase"
